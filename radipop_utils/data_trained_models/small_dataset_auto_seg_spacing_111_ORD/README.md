### Notes for future me; 

Original location of the data was: 
`~/data/cirdata/radiomics/Dataset125_LSS/regression/radipop_nnUNet_spacing_111_ORD/`

More details on settings for training, ... can be found there. 

Small means that it was trained on ~250 patients. ORD (=Only Real Data) means that only data for which I have a relibale HVPG measurment were included. This means that the healty patients (where we do not have a HVPG measurment) were excluded from the training as well. (Previously they were only ecluded from the evaluation (WFD= With Fake Data).
